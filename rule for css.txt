Always when starting with css for any webpage write the following code.
*{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
Reason:  These are the rules that sets some initial styling properties(it removes any default properties of margin, padding of each element) for all HTML elements.
Here's what each part of the code does:

*: This is a CSS universal selector. It selects all HTML elements on the page.

{}: These curly braces {} define a block of CSS rules that apply to the selected elements.

margin: 0;: This rule sets the margin of all elements to 0. The margin is the space outside the element's border.

padding: 0;: This rule sets the padding of all elements to 0. The padding is the space inside the element's border.

box-sizing: border-box;: This rule sets the box-sizing property of all elements to "border-box." This means that the width and height of an element will include the padding and border, but not the margin.

The purpose of this CSS code is to provide a consistent and uniform starting point for styling HTML elements on a web page. By resetting the margin and padding to 0 and setting the box-sizing to border-box, it helps prevent any unexpected default spacing or layout issues that may vary between different web browsers.

This is often referred to as a CSS "reset" or "normalize" rule and is commonly used as a best practice in web development to ensure cross-browser consistency in styling. Developers often build upon this reset by adding their own CSS rules to style specific elements as needed for their website's design.
